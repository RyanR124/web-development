    //---------------------------Rules in Javascript--------------------
    //two slashes are used to hide the code in Java script. front end means the part we can see is done with HTML and CSS.
    //backend part which makes the page function like; loops, comma varubles are done in javascript.
    //; is used at the end of every line in javascript. Its like full stop in javascript.
    //String are always written in " ". Numbers are not writtenb in " ".
    //---------------------------------------There are three ways to use Javscript-------------------
    //1. Internal Javascript: In this we do Javascript coding in html file. we use script tag and there we do the coding.
    //<script>
    //2. External Javascript : In this we create a seperate file where we do coding. with .js extension.  and connect that file with html file
    // <script src='script.js'></scriipt>  //

    //----------------------------------------We can do all Javascript coding Here-----------------
    //Javascript Functions:
    //1. document.write() : it display a message on screen. it is similar to p tag. 
    document.write("Hello this is ryan"+"<br>");
    //Javacsript does calculations so if we use a sign then it will perform the operation and show anserr on the screen
    document.write("2+3"+"<br>");//output  2+3
    document.write(2+3+"<br>"); //output: it will firts perform the operation and print the answer on screen
    //all things will come in on eline so use the br tag so that it can go to next line.
    // + sign can be used to join the text and variable together. if we put + sign between numbers it gonna add but if we put + between text or variable it will concat
    //or join them together.

    //2. To combine  HTML and ajavscript eg : let say nwe have creaed a button in HTML and we wnat to do some javascript coding on that then we have to combine that button tags with javascript so that we can do some javscript.
    //There are multiple ways to do that one of the way is use - document.getElementById("id name")=javscript code

    //in above function getElement means getting the tag and in () we write the tagname or id name and then after = we give javascript coding.
    //Note : Javascript is case sensitive that means something which is in capital letters has to b ecapital or something which is in small letters have to be in small letters.
    //When two words are there in function : first word is always small, first letter of the second word is capital.
    //Except the first word everyother word first letter is capital. if only word is there than everything small.
    
    //we get the tag p then innerHTML mneans javscript goes inside HTML and give whatever is written after =
    document.getElementById("pp").innerHTML=2+3+"<br>";
    //the answer is 5 which is given to p tag(its works is to give text) and when it gets 5 it displays on screen
    document.getElementById("ppp").innerHTML="this is good";


    //Note : in short write the idof tag in () we want to connect and after = write javascript


    //3. window.alert() :to displays a popup message
    window.alert("This is for coding");

//------------------------------Assignment--------------------------
//-, *(multiply), /(divide)
//print the table of 13 in seperate line using document.write from 1 to 10 use 
//document.write() 10 times
document.write(13*1+"<br>");
document.write(13*2+"<br>");
document.write(13*3+"<br>");
document.write(13*4+"<br>");
document.write(13*5+"<br>");
document.write(13*6+"<br>");
document.write(13*7+"<br>");
document.write(13*8+"<br>");
document.write(13*9+"<br>");
document.write(13*10+"<br>");
